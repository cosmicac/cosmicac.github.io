Arrived in Chengdu, Sichuan province. Metropolitan population: 18,047,625. It's a massive, sprawling megacity - known for its spicy food, dull weather, and relaxed lifestyle.

The instant we get out of the airport we're heckled by unlicensed cab drivers who feast on non-locals for a living. Unfortunately, they were pretty damn convincing and we got scammed - 100 RMB (~$14.38) for a 20 minute drive.

View from the hotel room. It's either super smoggy or foggy, or both.

We visit a temple. Circular doorways are so aesthetic.

Dried up lotus.

Still pond.

It's a real struggle waiting for a frame with no people in it. Bamboo on the side is very nice.

Playing with the lens-blur...

Of course there's a Starbucks. C o n s u m e r i s t b o y z.

Whoa, the interior of this Starbucks is lit af.

Dinner comes with a performance on the stage. The swan shadow is actually a performer making a swan's shape with his arms. Pretty cool.

Fish and various vegtables in a hot broth.

Next day, we're going on a day-trip to see the giant buddha of Leshan. Picture is outside one of Chengdu's train stations. China has lots of big buildings. Sky still hazy.

The mountains where the buddha is nested in.

The buddha itself. Originally the project was started by a monk who wanted to calm the nearby turbulent waters to prevent shipwrecks. He gouged his eyes out to show his commitment to the project when funding dried out initially. Now it's just here for Chinese tourists to take selfies with. Also, apparently the construction of the buddha moved so much cliff rock into the river, thus (un)intentionally calming the river currents.

The view from the hotel room the morning we're leaving Chengdu. The sunrise is actually visible. Haze is noticably thinner, the draw distance is longer. Final impressions - Chengdu is quite a livable city. The city is clean, has great food, and the new metro system is buttery smooth (way better than BART). It's too bad I didn't get to stay longer.
